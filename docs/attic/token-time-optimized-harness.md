## 1. Scope

This document is the founding design for the harness this repository will implement. The system
in one paragraph: a human and the orchestrator produce an approved technical plan; a manual,
operator-started **build loop** then grinds the plan task-by-task through context-isolated
**implementer** and **validator** subagents (the spec is their only shared context), merging
only through an objective gate; durable state lives on disk so any context can die and the loop
resumes from files alone; a reflection layer tunes cost and quality from telemetry, proposing —
never self-applying — changes to its own machinery. On top of that spine sits the explicit
dual-objective optimization layer this document specifies.

**Non-goals.** Portability off Claude Code (accepted coupling; model/tier indirection is the
seam if a fork ever needs one). Multi-operator teams. Large brownfield codebases (the
phased-ledger model is greenfield-shaped,
[landscape-and-novelty.md §5](../../../evidence-lake/ai/harness-landscape/landscape-and-novelty.md)). Auto-scheduled firings — whether a prior
firing is still alive cannot be judged reliably from a tool-call shell, so firings are
operator-started and operator-stopped, removing the double-run failure mode entirely.

## 2. The objective function

Lexicographic — never scalarized into one weighted score:

- **O0 — correctness floor (hard constraint).** Validation escapes ≈ 0, enforced by machinery,
  not model virtue. This is not over-engineering: evaluator-patching and hardcoded-pass reward
  hacking are measured behaviors (METR o3, DebugML's 28+ instances), ~31% of SWE-bench-Verified
  passes ride on tests too weak to catch a wrong fix, and a false "done" is the RLHF-default
  completion shape
  ([correctness-and-verification-evidence.md §1](../../../evidence-lake/ai/validation/correctness-and-verification-evidence.md)).
  **O0 is never traded for tokens or time.**
- **O1 — token spend against the Max windows.** The budget is not $/task; it is two rolling
  allowances — the 5-hour window and the weekly caps — shared account-wide. Consequences:
  - Spend that lands in a fresh window is *operationally cheaper* than spend near a wall:
    hitting the wall mid-panel wastes the whole in-flight panel.
  - The weekly cap makes *total build tokens* matter, not just burst rate: eliminating redundant
    re-reasoning (re-validation reuse §5.5, cache discipline §5.2) buys more build per week.
- **O2 — wall-clock to correct completion.** Includes human latency (ratification round-trips,
  parked-blocker waits), not just compute time.

Two rules are load-bearing enough to state up front:

- **Parallel lens breadth is not a wall-clock cost.** N diverse validator lenses run
  concurrently ≈ the slowest lens. Panel breadth is governed by O0 (risk) and O1 (tokens),
  and is **never** shrunk to save wall-clock.
- Controllers may economize on **token redundancy** (re-authoring, re-reasoning, prefix
  re-reads) and on **serialization idle** (empty concurrency slots). They may not economize on
  rigor where O0 applies (protected risk profiles: strengthen-only).

**The one real O1↔O2 exchange:** concurrent task pipelines. All parallel sessions and subagents
drain **one shared account pool** `[official]` — parallelism buys wall-clock only, never budget.
And at equal thinking-token budget a single agent *matches or outperforms* multi-agent on
multi-hop reasoning (arXiv 2604.02460 `[measured]`; scoped to reasoning benchmarks, not coding) —
so parallelism is purchased *only* out of window headroom (§6.2), never assumed free. The same
result predicts multi-agent becomes competitive precisely when a single agent's context
utilization degrades — the long-session regime — which is why the harness still fans out for
*context isolation* (§3 principle 3) rather than treating the citation as a blanket ban on decomposition.

## 3. Design principles

1. **Built-in before custom** (§4 is the map). If Claude Code ships it — subagents, worktrees,
   hooks, skills, caching, structured output, telemetry — the harness configures it rather than
   rebuilding it. Custom shell scripts are the residue, and each must justify itself in the
   evidence trail (§8) or be pruned.
2. **Zero-token enforcement.** Everything safety- or budget-load-bearing runs as a **hook or
   script** — deterministic, model-free, un-skippable, costs no context. Prose guards burn
   tokens every turn *and* get skipped exactly when the loop is degraded
   ([landscape-and-novelty.md §4](../../../evidence-lake/ai/harness-landscape/landscape-and-novelty.md)). Command
   hooks cost 0 tokens; prompt/agent hooks cost tokens and are reserved for rare gates
   `[official]`.
3. **Context isolation is also compression.** Subagents exist for correctness (blind
   validation) *and* economy: a worker's exploration tokens die with its context; only the
   structured return crosses to the orchestrator. This is the token-efficient fan-out pattern
   Anthropic itself uses (multi-agent research system `[official]`).
4. **Disk is the memory.** Phase ledgers, the status index, the run-log, and the lessons corpus
   live on disk; any context can die at any moment and the loop resumes from files alone. This
   makes fresh-context workers (and orchestrator compaction) free in *correctness* terms, so
   the token optimizer can use them aggressively. Four mechanics keep that state trustworthy
   under crashes and concurrency ([unattended-operation-prior-art.md §1](../../../evidence-lake/ai/unattended-operation/unattended-operation-prior-art.md)):
   ledgers and run-logs are **append-only event logs**; *current* state is always a **derived
   reconciliation** whose authoritative inputs are gate/run artifacts and git — never the last
   log line (after a resolved gate the tail still reads `needs-decision`); durable events are
   written **before** the progress markers that suppress them advance (write-ahead — a crash at
   any point recovers by draining the queue); and mutations of shared state carry a
   **generation stamp** so a stale read fails loudly instead of silently clobbering (load-bearing
   the moment concurrency exceeds 1, §6.2).
5. **Measure, then move.** Every economy lever ships with its telemetry and a ground-truth
   check (the escapes log, calibration canaries). No downgrade without a catch-proof; one
   lever at a time; sample floors respected. Limits themselves are volatile (§10.3) — ceilings
   are calibrated empirically, never hard-coded.

## 4. Leverage map — need → Claude Code built-in → custom residue

| Need | Built-in (how) | Residue we still build |
|---|---|---|
| Isolated worker contexts | **Subagents** (`.claude/agents/*.md`; per-agent `model`, `tools`; summary-only return) `[official]` | Spec-only shared-input discipline; verdict/handoff schemas |
| Parallel file edits, zero conflicts | **Git worktrees** (`claude --worktree`, subagent `isolation: worktree`, `.worktreeinclude`, auto-cleanup) `[official]` | Pooled lease-based lifecycle at Stage 2: warm pool with env-setup hooks, durable leases, fail-closed teardown with precise "landed" semantics (§6.2) |
| Un-skippable enforcement, 0 tokens | **Hooks** (PreToolUse / PostToolUse / Stop / SubagentStop / SessionStart; deny>ask>allow; matchers) `[official]` | The merge-gate scripts the hooks invoke |
| Reusable procedures, cheap until used | **Skills** with progressive disclosure (names at start, body on invoke) `[official]` | The skill content itself (planning, build loop, calibration, status); phase-gated invocation for load-bearing procedures — triggering is unreliable (§5.4 skills discipline) |
| Interactive planning w/o edits | **Plan mode** `[official]` | The plan template, risk-classification table, human gate |
| Completion gating | **Stop hooks** (script-based; model-evaluated goal hooks) `[official]` | Closure gate vs frozen plan snapshot + fresh-evidence rule |
| Structured worker returns | **`--json-schema` / structured outputs** (server-side validation) `[official]` | The verdict/report schemas themselves |
| Model routing | Per-subagent `model` param; session `/model`; aliases `[official]` | Abstract tier indirection + per-task routing policy (§5.3) |
| Effort routing | Session `/effort`; per-agent `effort` on the Workflow/Agent spawn path (verified by direct probe) | Per-profile effort config + the spawn-path fallback ladder |
| Cost/usage telemetry | Statusline `rate_limits.{five_hour,seven_day}` + `resets_at` + `current_usage` (in-session, server-side utilization); `/usage`, `--output-format json` (per-turn tokens/cost), OTEL consumption metrics, per-subagent token totals `[official]` | Per-role run-log aggregation + the budget governor's source ladder (§5.1) |
| Prompt-cache economy | **Automatic prompt caching** (1h TTL auto on subscription, 5-min on credits/subagents; auto breakpoints; model+effort are cache-key components) `[official]` | The *discipline* (§5.2): freeze-prefix rules, escalate-at-boundary |
| Tool-definition economy | **ToolSearch deferred loading** (names only at start; schema on use — default for MCP) `[official]` | Keep the MCP surface minimal; prefer CLI tools (`gh`) over MCP servers `[official + replicated]`; pin each worker's hot set eagerly — defer only long-tail catalogs (§5.4 regime rule) |
| Long-lived instructions | CLAUDE.md (<200 lines guidance), path-scoped rules, `@imports`, auto-memory `[official]` | Lessons corpus + orchestrator-curated injection at spawn |
| Resume across deaths | Session persistence, `--resume`/`--continue`/`--fork-session` `[official]` | Ledgers + status index as the *canonical* resume state (disk > transcript — resuming a huge transcript reprocesses it at full cost `[measured]`) |
| Undo | `/rewind` checkpoints (session-local) `[official]` | Git remains canonical history; checkpoints are convenience only |
| Headless execution | `claude -p`, `--allowedTools`, `stream-json`, `--bare` `[official]` | The build-loop skill + an advisory single-run marker |
| Background work | Background bash, background subagents, batched parallel tool calls `[official]` | Fan-out patterns (§6.1) |
| Output filtering | PostToolUse hooks pre-filtering tool output (10k-line log → the failures) `[official example]` | Which filters to apply per gate command; the standard filter shape is tail-biased truncation + full artifact spilled to disk with path and grep hint (§6.1) |

**Deliberately not used:** auto-cron firing of the build loop (see Non-goals); agent teams for
implementation (≈7× a standard session `[official]`, and Anthropic's own caveat: coding has few
truly parallelizable interdependent tasks `[official]` — the parallel-friendly part of this loop
is validation, which subagent fan-out already covers); `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in the environment
(silently bills API instead of the subscription `[official]`).

## 5. The token-economy layer (O1)

### 5.1 Window model and budget governor

Facts the governor is built on (details + volatility log in §10):

- The 5-hour window **anchors at the first message**, not rolling continuously `[measured]`;
  weekly caps reset at a fixed per-account time `[official]`. Current caps: one overall weekly
  + one **Sonnet-specific** weekly (the Opus-specific cap was removed Nov 2025) `[official]`.
- **Everything shares one pool**: Claude app + every Claude Code session + every subagent
  `[official]`. Depletion factors: model, effort, thinking (billed as output), tools,
  attachments `[official]`.
- No token quotas are published, and limits/accounting rules changed ≥7 times in 12 months
  (§10.3) — **ceilings must be runtime-calibrated, never hard-coded**.

The **budget governor** is a small deterministic script the loop consults **between** tasks
("don't start what you can't finish"). It reads window occupancy from a source ladder,
best-source-first:

- `statusline` — the officially-documented statusline stdin JSON exposes
  `rate_limits.five_hour.used_percentage`, `rate_limits.seven_day.used_percentage`, and
  `resets_at` (Unix epoch), plus `context_window.current_usage` cache counters. This is
  **server-side utilization, machine-readable in-session, zero extra tokens** — the primary rung
  `[official]`.
- `oauth-usage` — for unattended/headless firings that lack a statusline surface, the
  undocumented `GET api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` (Bearer token + `anthropic-beta:
  oauth-2025-04-20`) returns five_hour / seven_day / seven_day_sonnet utilization; an
  **unstable internal endpoint**, used only as a fallback `[measured]`.
- `estimate` — per-role token sums from the run-log over rolling windows; the last-resort
  fallback, and **systematically optimistic**: it cannot see quota the operator's own
  interactive Claude app / IDE use drains from the same shared pool `[official]`, so it
  under-counts true occupancy. Never the sole source when a live-utilization rung is available.

(The former `quota-file` rung — operator-fed from `/usage` — is dropped: the statusline feed
supersedes it. A dedicated quota CLI, anthropics/claude-code#13585, remains unshipped; the ladder
upgrades in place if it lands. For headless firings, a **statusline-dump shim** — a statusline
command on the operator's interactive session that tees its stdin JSON to a file the governor
reads — slots between the first two rungs: official data via unofficial acquisition, staling
when the host session idles; see §12 Q1.) The occupancy reading drives two thresholds:

- **degrade** (default 0.8 of a window): panels shrink to profile minimums (never below a risk
  floor), no new tasks start, in-flight work commits; the implementer starting tier steps down
  where the profile allows (§5.3).
- **pause** (default 0.95): clean pause — resume marker to the status index, worktrees
  reconciled, run marker released. The next firing after the window reset resumes from disk.

Thresholds ship **observe-only** first (log the crossing, don't act) so ceilings are tuned on
real telemetry before they gate work — untuned hard caps stall the whole loop (§11).

Two rules added 2026-07-04 (evening), because unattended firings otherwise run on the *weakest*
quota telemetry precisely when it matters most (the statusline rung is interactive-only, the
shim stales when the host session idles, the estimate rung is optimistic *and* blind to the
operator's other usage, and agents measurably cannot self-throttle):

- **Readings carry their age.** Every occupancy reading records when it was produced; the
  governor treats a reading older than a configurable staleness ceiling as **degraded** — it
  widens the admission margin with data age and falls through to the next rung rather than
  consuming a six-hour-old number as live.
- **Firing preflight.** At firing start the loop probes the source ladder; if **no
  live-utilization rung is reachable**, the firing starts in **conservative mode** (tightened
  degrade/pause thresholds, admission margin bumped, cheap-serial work only) or requires an
  explicit operator acknowledgment. A firing never silently begins full-fan-out on
  estimate-rung data alone.

Two driver/accounting rules ride the ladder
([unattended-operation-prior-art.md §3](../../../evidence-lake/ai/unattended-operation/unattended-operation-prior-art.md)):

- **Failure taxonomy.** Agent-*reported* task failures continue the loop (they are the §5.3
  escalation signal); retryable infrastructure errors back off exponentially; permanent errors
  (auth, credit exhaustion) abort the firing at once — a stderr-pattern table, not a judgment
  call.
- **Estimated readings are sticky.** Once any reading in a window came from the `estimate`
  rung, every total derived from it is flagged estimated (`~`) downstream — measured and
  guessed numbers are never silently blended.

**Window-aware admission** (the scheduler input, §6.2): each candidate task carries a **quantile**
cost forecast, never a point estimate — measured same-task token spend varies up to **30×** on
identical agentic-coding tasks, and neither model self-estimates (r ≤ 0.39, systematically low)
nor human difficulty ratings track burn well `[measured; arXiv 2604.22750]`. Forecast on a tail
percentile (P95-of-rolling-window, ≈ 4× the mean in practice `[folklore]`), carry per-(tier,
effort) overshoot variance since thinking budgets are soft targets not hard caps (§5.3), and
admit against the degrade threshold **with the forecast added burn**. A heavy critical-profile
task is admitted early in a fresh window; near a wall only cheap routine tasks (or nothing)
start. Escape valve: extra-usage credits at API rates exist (`/usage-credits`, $2k/day cap
`[official]`) — but they are **opt-in-in-advance with no silent spillover** `[official]`, so an
unattended run halts cleanly at the wall unless credits were pre-enabled; surfaced to the operator
as a *choice* at pause time, never auto-purchased.

### 5.2 Prompt-cache discipline (the #1 hidden lever)

Measured reality: a session carries a 20–30k-token prefix (system prompt + CLAUDE.md + memory
+ tool names) re-sent every turn `[measured]`; in one 30-day single-user measurement, cache-read
volume ran **1,310× fresh I/O tokens** and scaled with CLAUDE.md size, not workload
`[measured; one user, anthropics/claude-code#24147]`. Whether cache reads count against
*subscription* limits at a discount or near-full weight is **`[contested]`** (§10.2; community
telemetry points to near-full window weight, still officially unanswered) — under either reading,
the design conclusion is identical: **cache-busting is the catastrophic spend event** (one client
cache bug produced 10–20× inflation before it was fixed `[measured]`), and the prefix must be
small and immutable.

Rules (mechanized where possible):

1. **Frozen prefix per firing.** The actual mid-firing cache-busters `[official]` are: a
   `/model` switch, an `/effort` change, the first fast-mode toggle (all three are cache-key
   components), a bare-tool deny rule (`Bash`, `WebFetch` — tool defs live in the system-prompt
   layer), and a non-deferred MCP connect/disconnect. These do not change mid-firing — model,
   effort, hook set, MCP set, and skill inventory are fixed at spawn; escalation happens at a
   worker boundary, never mid-transcript (§5.3). Mechanization: a PreToolUse hook flags
   mid-firing edits to prefix files (`Edit|Write` matcher on CLAUDE.md / constraints / settings)
   — note that a mid-session CLAUDE.md edit does not actually bust the cache but **silently
   fails to apply** until the next `/clear` or restart `[official]`, so the hook guards against
   the silent no-op as much as the spend event.
2. **Small prefix.** CLAUDE.md stays under ~200 lines `[official guidance]`; reference material
   lives in skills (progressive disclosure) and path-scoped rules; lessons are injected
   per-spawn by the orchestrator, not resident in the prefix.
3. **TTL cadence.** On subscription auth Claude Code requests the **1-hour TTL automatically**
   (no `ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H` — that env var is API-key-only), but it **silently drops to 5
   minutes while drawing on usage credits** `[official]`. Subagents get the 5-minute TTL even on
   subscription and start cold; forks inherit the parent cache `[official]`. The build loop's
   inner cadence turns over faster than either TTL while working; a *planned* long gap (awaiting
   a human) is one cache miss, accepted. Long-idle sessions are ended cleanly rather than kept
   warm artificially.
4. **Never resume a huge transcript for a new task.** Fresh session + disk state beats
   `--resume` of a long history: resume reprocesses the full transcript **after a Claude Code
   upgrade or once the TTL lapses** (within-TTL resume hits the warm cache) `[official]`, and a
   resumed idle session attributes its whole accumulated cache context to the **new** rate
   window — measured 15M tokens charged for ~20k of real work `[measured]`. Ledgers are the
   resume state; treat any idle-session resume as a heavy admission (§9), not a free
   continuation.
5. **Workers are short-lived by construction.** Implementers/validators are subagents (or
   headless `-p` one-shots): they pay their prefix once, do one task, die. No compaction debt
   accumulates anywhere except the orchestrator, whose context is structured-state-only.

### 5.3 Model + effort routing (two axes, start low, escalate on proof)

Model selection is indirected through abstract tiers (cheap / standard / capable / max →
concrete model ids in one config table), and rigor is expressed as named **risk profiles**
(e.g. routine < elevated < high < critical), each specifying validator count, lenses, tier,
and effort. On top of that:

Start-cheap-escalate-on-proof is established prior art, not folklore: learned-scorer cascades
match a top model at up to 98% lower cost (FrugalGPT), and effort routing cuts reasoning tokens
35–53% at 0–2pt success loss (ARES) `[measured]`. But the savings band is task-dependent — ~73–98%
on knowledge/chat/math benchmarks, **~56% best-case on code generation, ~30% out-of-distribution**
`[measured]` — so the harness's coding domain sits at the low end, and a router trained on a
mismatched distribution can perform *worse than random* `[measured]`. Two consequences: the
design's escalation signal is a *verified durable FAIL* (higher-precision than a learned scorer,
but it pays a full failed attempt per misroute — which is what the break-even guardrail is for),
and a validated **upfront** router (the duration predictor) is worth more than a longer escalation
chain (pre-generation routing beats pure escalate-on-failure on 4 of 5 benchmarks by avoiding the
wasted cheap attempt `[measured]`).

- **Tier axis — per-task starting tier.** Start the implementer as cheap as the task's risk
  allows and let an escalation ladder (N durable FAILs → bump one tier) walk it up; the gate +
  validator panel remain the correctness net. Keep the ladder **multi-rung** — the claim that a
  two-tier cheap→capable pair captures all the value did not survive adversarial verification
  (refuted 1-2), so it is not adopted. Staged rollout: ship the simple per-profile starting-tier
  override first; a deterministic **duration-bucket predictor** (scored from spec size, file
  count, subsystem breadth, novelty — a script, not an LLM call, since models cannot self-predict
  their own token spend, r ≤ 0.39 `[measured]`) and the full bucket×profile starting-tier matrix
  stay behind a flag until (a) the simple lever's telemetry proves escapes ~0 and $/task down and
  (b) the predictor's features are validated against *measured* burn — human difficulty ratings
  track cost only weakly `[measured]`, so the features are not assumed-good. Guardrails,
  non-negotiable:
  1. *Safety is not a cost lever* — tasks on protected profiles or risk-floored surfaces never
     start cheap.
  2. *Nature beats difficulty* — recency-sensitive tasks (APIs newer than the cheap tier's
     training) route off cheap regardless of size.
  3. *Escalation churn has a break-even* — at roughly >40% cheap-tier failure on a bucket, the
     wasted attempt + re-run costs more than starting one tier up; the controller trips the
     start tier back up when telemetry crosses it. (This threshold is exactly the >40%-failure
     regime where published work says upfront routing should replace the cascade `[measured]`.)
- **Effort axis** *(rewritten 2026-07-05 — local benchmark,
  [token-economics-and-scheduling.md §2b](../../../evidence-lake/ai/economics/token-economics-and-scheduling.md)):*
  on the adaptive-thinking lineup (Fable 5 / Opus 4.8 / Sonnet 5) effort is a
  thinking-budget *ceiling* the model spends only when the task warrants —
  measured locally, easy tasks cost the same at every effort. So the harness
  default is **uniform `xhigh`** (Claude Code's own documented default for
  coding/agentic work): the overthinking risk that motivated per-profile
  effort routing is superseded on this lineup, while "always-low drops
  success" still holds (Sonnet 5 measured wrong at low/medium where
  Opus/Fable at low were right — effort-down is not a safe economy).
  `max` is reserved as the escalation rung (deliberation at diminishing
  returns); Haiku 4.5 has no effort control at all. The paragraph below
  documents the superseded per-profile-effort regime for models without
  adaptive thinking. Profiles carry `effort` alongside `model`. The Workflow-based spawn path
  threads per-agent `model` *and* `effort` (re-verified by direct probe on Claude Code 2.1.45,
  2026-07-04: all five effort levels dispatch; both tested model overrides are honored — see
  [tools/budget-governor/probe-spawn-portability-2026-07-04.md](../../tools/budget-governor/probe-spawn-portability-2026-07-04.md)),
  with a batch of parallel `Agent` calls as the portable fallback (model-only; effort
  session-level). *(2026-07-05 pilot confirmation, P3v2-6 → I24)*: pilot-3-v2 hit this
  fallback limitation live — an orchestrator escalating via `Agent` spawns cannot actuate a
  `max`-effort rung; it correctly substituted a fresh same-tier worker with sharpened
  spec-grounded feedback, which landed the fix on attempt 2. The build-loop ladder is now
  stated in actuatable terms — feedback, then tier — with the effort rung reserved for
  spawn paths that verifiably apply it. *(Same-day docs addendum)*: official docs also
  support an `effort:` field in subagent **definition frontmatter** (`.claude/agents/*.md`),
  overriding session effort for `Agent`-tool spawns of that agent type `[official]` — a
  fourth surface, unprobed for application (the recurring effort theme: acceptance is
  silent, application must be *measured*). If a probe verifies it, pre-committed variants
  (e.g. an `effort: max` implementer definition) would give the `Agent` path a legal
  per-spawn rung with no mid-firing machinery edit. Headless `claude -p --effort` remains
  the one measured-applied path (benchmark round 2: low→max scales thinking 2.4–4.2× by
  model). Docs further claim Haiku 4.5 accepts low/medium/high/max — this **conflicts**
  with the local measurement (no behavioral change at any level, round 1); measured wins
  for the tested build, re-probe on version moves. *(2026-07-05 evening, I26)*: resolved —
  **headless one-shot `claude -p` workers are now the loop's spawn path**: per-spawn
  `--model` (concrete allowlisted id) and `--effort` (the measured-applied path) both bind,
  `--json-schema` forces the role contract, and `worker_settings` binds per-worktree
  (`.claude/settings.local.json`) — realizing §7 layer 6's divergent per-role policy, which
  Agent-tool subagents structurally cannot do (they inherit the parent session wholesale).
  Deny rules and blocking PreToolUse hooks survive `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
  `[official]`, so the isolation stack holds headless. The Agent-tool path demotes to an
  environment fallback (model-only, effort advisory, downgrade recorded). The escalation
  ladder regains its effort rung: attempt 2 = same tier @ `max` + sharpened feedback;
  attempt 3+ = tier up. *(2026-07-05 night, I28 — P3v2-12)*: **Fable 5 is removed from the
  machinery.** It carries a model-specific weekly cap far below the general windows — hit
  live: a critical test-author died `429 "out of usage credits … Fable 5"` on its FIRST
  call (0 tokens) while the general windows read 0.82/0.63 — and it is the operator's
  primary interactive model, so machinery spend directly starves interactive work. The
  `max` tier temporarily aliases `capable` (opus): profiles and the ladder keep their
  shape, tier-up saturates at opus (an attempt-3 tier-up from capable is a no-op — park
  for the operator instead), and the allowlist no longer admits `claude-fable-5` at all.
  Reintroduction is one tiers.json line, gated on the cap rising or interactive usage
  reliably dropping. Firing orchestrator sessions likewise run non-fable models — an
  orchestrator on a capped model cannot even emit its own turns. **Correction:** "invalid ids fail loud" does not hold as previously stated —
  an invalid `effort` string is **silently accepted** with no error, and an invalid `model` id
  fails only as an async `null` result + a workflow-level log entry, not a catchable throw.
  **The spawn code must therefore validate `(model, effort)` against an explicit allowlist
  before calling `agent()`/`Workflow`**, and must check results for `null` rather than relying on
  an exception. Effort lands in the run-log so the controller segments cost/catch-rate by
  `(tier, model_id, effort)`.
  **Neither uniform default is safe:** always-low drops agent success ~20pts, always-high
  overthinks trivial work (≈1,953% extra tokens on trivial inputs) `[measured]` — effort is
  *routed*, never a static default. Effort is a **soft** target with an overshoot tail, not a
  hard cap `[official]`, which is why the governor carries per-(tier, effort) variance (§5.1).
  Downgrades require a fresh calibration PASS at the lower effort; protected profiles: raise-only.
- **Escalation ordering — effort before tier, always at a worker boundary.** Both model and
  effort are cache-key components `[official]`: a mid-session bump of either busts the full
  cache (§5.2). So escalation never happens mid-transcript — it happens at the next fresh worker
  spawn, where a cold cache is paid anyway. Given that, prefer an *effort* bump before a *tier*
  bump: within one model, an escalated respawn can be cheaper to warm, and tier changes drain a
  different weekly pool (below).
- **Routing floor for grunt work:** mechanical fan-out (file moves, renames, log filtering,
  status sweeps) always runs cheap-tier subagents — deliberate routing cuts cost substantially
  (the published band above; the gate catches any miss).
- **Regime-aware tier routing** *(added 2026-07-05 — local benchmark + pilot-2 P2-16)*:
  per-token speed is not task speed. Measured on the 2026 lineup, the wall-clock ranking
  **inverts by regime** — thinking-dominated work: Fable fastest (3–5× fewer tokens to a
  correct answer), Haiku slowest despite 255 tok/s; tool-loop chores: Sonnet/Haiku fastest
  (TTFT + per-turn overhead dominate). Cost per *solved* thinking-heavy task: Opus ≈ Sonnet,
  Fable ≈ 1.6–1.8× Sonnet — the price ladder is not the cost ladder where thinking dominates.
  So implementer tier-down (the I12 experiment) is conditioned on the task's **regime**
  (`chore | thinking | long_horizon`), assigned by the planner at plan time (the zero-ML v1
  of the §5.3 duration-bucket predictor — buckets with **asymmetric loss**: the only
  expensive error is routing long/thinking work down, so when unsure, route up; validated
  against run-log telemetry at the same Stage-1 gate before any learned predictor replaces
  the tags; [task-horizon-prediction.md](../../../evidence-lake/ai/routing/task-horizon-prediction.md)). Chores
  route down freely; thinking-regime tasks never start below `standard`; long-horizon tasks
  keep their profile's base tier.
- **Weekly-pool awareness:** with the model-specific weekly cap now on **Sonnet** rather than
  Opus `[official]`, "route grunt work down-tier" is no longer automatically
  weekly-budget-safer. The controller tracks which pool each tier drains and re-checks the
  mapping after every Anthropic limit change (§10.3).

### 5.4 Context hygiene

- Orchestrator ingests **structured state only** (statuses, verdicts, decisions) — never raw
  file dumps; heavy reading is delegated and dies with the subagent.
- Workers receive **scoped specs** (the task's ledger entry + injected lessons), not the whole
  plan; specific file paths, not pasted file contents `[official guidance]`.
- **Tool surface: small, hot-set-pinned, ergonomic.** MCP surface minimal — the schema tax is
  independently replicated at tens of K tokens per large server; prefer CLI/code paths over MCP
  servers `[official + replicated]`. Deferred loading (ToolSearch) follows a **regime rule**,
  not a blanket default: defer only when the catalog is large (≫10k tokens of definitions)
  *and* the per-task hot set is a small fraction of it; the small set a worker certainly uses
  is loaded eagerly / pinned non-deferred — deferral in the wrong regime measurably costs
  discovery turns and success, and Anthropic's own docs state the boundary
  ([tool-surface-and-format-economics.md §2–3](../../../evidence-lake/ai/tool-surface/tool-surface-and-format-economics.md)).
  `.claudeignore` tuned (measured up to ~85% context reduction `[measured]`). The replicated
  meta-finding governing all of this: **interface ergonomics — few, well-described, well-shaped
  tools — dominates the transport choice** `[measured, replicated]`.
- **Serialization-format policy** (verified incl. local measurements on this harness's own
  shapes, [tool-surface-and-format-economics.md §4](../../../evidence-lake/ai/tool-surface/tool-surface-and-format-economics.md)):
  never pretty-print into model context (+48–82% tokens for nothing); **compact JSON/JSONL** is
  the format for persisted state (ledger, run-log — semi-uniform shapes where tabular formats
  lose) and the *only* format models generate (schema-validated; TOON/CSV generation
  reliability is independently negative). Digest views built *for* model reading (status
  summaries, run-log projections) are **flattened first, then rendered as Markdown tables**
  (~37% cheaper than compact JSON on our shapes, training-prior familiar, at the accuracy
  Pareto frontier in the only independent multi-format test). TOON is reserved, if ever, for
  large uniform tables consumed by deterministic scripts — its read-accuracy claims are
  `[contested, leaning negative]`. Format conservatism is a cheap-tier *correctness* concern,
  not just economy: format sensitivity concentrates in small models — exactly where §5.3
  routes most turns.
- **Skills discipline.** Skill *loading* is cheap (progressive disclosure) but *triggering* is
  unreliable — direction independently corroborated: Anthropic's own trigger-quality
  admissions, a ~15k-char skill-list budget that silently drops overflow, ~45–50% activation
  in an independent probe
  ([harness-evaluation-prior-art.md §1, §5.1](../../../evidence-lake/ai/evaluation/harness-evaluation-prior-art.md)).
  Rules: few skills with short, tested descriptions; the installed inventory is checked
  against the list budget; **load-bearing procedures are invoked phase-gated in the
  orchestration prompt (deterministic text, immune to trigger recall), never
  trigger-reliant**; situational skills carry explicit trigger conditions ("when X and you
  can't see why, run Y — don't guess-and-patch"); skill-routing canaries (fixture prompts
  including negative controls where *no* skill should fire) sit in the self-test suite
  alongside the §7 calibration canaries.
- Compaction is a survivable event, not a stop — but the *economical* pattern is to make it
  rare by keeping the orchestrator lean, and to prefer clean session boundaries
  (`/clear`-equivalent + disk resume) over repeated `/compact` (compaction is itself a model
  call over the history `[official]`).

### 5.5 Re-validation reuse — the vault (biggest O1 lever on retries)

On a durable-FAIL re-validation, a naive loop re-authors held-out tests and re-reviews a
~95%-unchanged diff — pure token redundancy. Design (evidence base:
[revalidation-reuse-and-leakage.md](../../../evidence-lake/ai/validation/revalidation-reuse-and-leakage.md)):

1. **Implementer-blind held-out vault.** Panel-authored held-out tests persist where the
   implementer's context/worktree can never see them; isolation is the OS-enforced six-layer
   stack in §7 (sandbox `denyRead` + Read/Edit deny rules + strict-mode flags + out-of-scope
   config + egress control + separate-process roles), not path convention — hidden tests have
   been exfiltrated from autograders via submitted code, and a Claude Code agent has
   autonomously disabled its own sandbox
   ([isolation-and-sandboxing.md](../../../evidence-lake/ai/isolation/isolation-and-sandboxing.md)). Proven by a
   vault-canary read-attempt in the gate self-tests, not assumed.
2. **Safe incremental re-validation.** On re-validation, **replay** the vault against the
   unchanged surface (zero re-authoring tokens) under the Ekstazi/TIA **safe-RTS property** —
   never skip a test the change could affect; full-run fallback for anything unanalyzable
   ([revalidation-reuse-and-leakage.md §2](../../../evidence-lake/ai/validation/revalidation-reuse-and-leakage.md)).
3. **Fresh authoring on the changed surface is mandatory.** A replayed corpus is a regression
   floor, structurally unable to find a new hole (frozen corpus = saturated corpus; ~27% of
   real faults uncoupled from standard mutants —
   [revalidation-reuse-and-leakage.md §4](../../../evidence-lake/ai/validation/revalidation-reuse-and-leakage.md)). The
   vault shrinks re-authoring; it never eliminates it.
4. **Leakage budget.** Reuse of a fixed hidden set across adaptive fix-iterations degrades it
   (Ladder/Thresholdout,
   [revalidation-reuse-and-leakage.md §5](../../../evidence-lake/ai/validation/revalidation-reuse-and-leakage.md)):
   rate-limit replays, rotate/refresh the corpus, and keep **full fresh re-derivation on
   risk-floored surfaces** — exactly where a gamed frozen set is most dangerous.
5. **Evidence artifacts are a leakage channel too** *(2026-07-04 evening amendment)*. The gate's
   committed evidence directories and verbose verdicts can carry held-out content (test names,
   assertion text, full execution logs) into paths a retry implementer can read — an adaptive-
   reuse leak around the six-layer stack. Policy: **held-out execution output routes to a
   vault-side evidence store** covered by the same deny rules; in-repo gate reports are
   **scrubbed against the vault manifest** (vault-relative paths/test identifiers replaced with
   stable hashes); behavior-level verdict quotes are the accepted, budgeted leak — full held-out
   logs are not. Verdict verbosity gets its own line in the leakage budget.

### 5.6 What the harness deliberately does not spend on

- No auto-cron; no idle-warm sessions; no speculative implementation of pre-decomposed
  (provisional) ledgers — look-ahead is planning-only.
- No free-running reflection: reflection triggers on ground-truth events (an escape, a canary
  miss, a durable FAIL), never as open-ended synthesis (intrinsic self-correction *degrades*
  without external signal —
  [correctness-and-verification-evidence.md §2](../../../evidence-lake/ai/validation/correctness-and-verification-evidence.md)).
- **No implementer-side ceremony without paired proof.** Mandated process in worker prompts
  (workflow scripts, test-first mandates, guideline prose) is a candidate net-negative until a
  paired A/B clears it: mandated agent-authored TDD measured at +55% cost for null-to-negative
  quality on hidden tests, guideline prose slightly hurting, instruction load degrading
  compliance ([harness-evaluation-prior-art.md §2, §5.2](../../../evidence-lake/ai/evaluation/harness-evaluation-prior-art.md)).
  Validator-side rigor is exempt — governed by O0, never by this rule. The same evidence is
  *why* the vault is panel-authored and hidden: an implementer iterating against self-authored
  visible tests is the measured overfitting regime (21.8–33% visible-pass-hidden-fail,
  refinement makes it worse).
- **No spending-through a doomed trajectory.** Agents are measurably over-optimistic and keep
  spending on tasks unlikely to succeed rather than alerting early
  (r = 0.35 capability↔budget-awareness) `[measured]`; an external abort-on-predicted-failure
  check inside long-running tasks (§9 liveness guard) recovers 28–64% of the tokens a failing
  trajectory would otherwise burn `[measured]`. Ships observe-only, with false-aborts counted
  against the O0 floor before it gates.
- Dormant opt-in controllers are pruned on evidence (§8); insurance controllers (risk floors,
  calibration, closure, budget) are exempt — there, silence is the desired state.
- `DISABLE_NON_ESSENTIAL_MODEL_CALLS=1` on headless firings `[official]`.

## 6. The wall-clock layer (O2)

### 6.1 Token-free accelerators first

These cut elapsed time without buying tokens; they are always on:

1. **Pipelining:** task N+1's spec + contract tests are authored while task N validates; the
   next phase pre-decomposes into a provisional (planning-only, not runnable) ledger while the
   current phase's last task runs.
2. **Global cross-phase DAG scheduling:** each tick, candidates = every not-started task whose
   hard deps are complete, **any phase**; fill idle slots prioritized by critical-path, then
   risk; gated by a `start-early-safe` predicate (soft `mayBeInvalidatedBy` edges in the task
   schema) so pulled-forward work is never likely rework — wall-clock bought without
   wasted-token risk. Phase tags stay for human legibility; the read-only preflight check
   verifies the cross-phase dependency graph is a DAG.
3. **Panels are always batched-parallel.** One turn, N `Agent` calls (or one Workflow
   `parallel()`): wall-clock ≈ slowest lens. This is why lens breadth is O0/O1-governed only.
4. **Hooks over prose.** Every deterministic check that would otherwise be an orchestrator
   turn (merge gating, git-state checks, output filtering) runs as a hook — zero tokens *and*
   zero turn latency.
5. **Structured outputs everywhere** (`--json-schema` / schema-forced subagent returns):
   eliminates parse-repair round-trips `[official]`.
6. **Turn economy on every worker-read surface.** Each extra turn re-sends the whole growing
   context, so follow-up-call elimination is a first-class accelerator — the decisive results
   in the tool-surface benchmarks were all turn-count stories
   ([tool-surface-and-format-economics.md §1–2](../../../evidence-lake/ai/tool-surface/tool-surface-and-format-economics.md)).
   Every status/verdict/gate artifact carries **pre-computed aggregates** (`count: N of T`,
   derived pass/fail roll-ups) so the obvious next question is pre-answered; empty results are
   **definitive** (`runnable: 0 (3 blocked, 2 parked)`), never ambiguous blanks that force a
   verification retry; act+observe steps are **fused** where a follow-up read is near-certain;
   errors are structured, carry the fix inline (one-turn self-correction), and land on the
   channel the worker reads; oversized output is **tail-truncated** (failures live at the end)
   with the full artifact spilled to disk and its path + a grep hint returned.

### 6.2 Paid parallelism — admission-controlled by window headroom

A concurrency cap >1 (worktree-isolated implement→validate pipelines) is the one lever that
spends tokens to buy time. Admission rule, evaluated per tick:

> Admit a second/third concurrent pipeline **only if** (a) window occupancy is below the
> degrade threshold *and forecast (on the P95 quantile, §5.1) to stay below it with the added
> burn*, (b) the runnable set contains genuinely independent tasks (hard deps +
> `mayBeInvalidatedBy` clear), and (c) a surface-contention cap (max concurrent surfaces) is
> respected.

The admission cost side must include a **per-pipeline cache warmup**: worktrees do *not* share
prefix cache (the cache is scoped per machine+directory, and each worktree is a distinct cwd
`[official]`), so every concurrent pipeline pays its own ~20–30k-token cold prefix; each commit
likewise cold-starts the next fresh session's prefix (the git snapshot is part of the system
prompt) `[official]`. Rationale: bursting a fresh 5-hour window empty in <1h then stalling 4h is a
*wall-clock loss*, not a win — on subscriptions the binding constraint is often the window, not
total tokens `[folklore, consistent]`. Practitioner consensus caps useful concurrency at 2–4
pipelines `[folklore]`; the run-log attributes rework/merge-conflict cost to concurrency so the
controller can tune the cap on evidence. Anthropic's frontier fan-out datapoints — a **90.2%**
quality gain over single-agent on an internal research eval (at *unequal*, much larger budget),
a separately-reported time reduction from parallelism, and a **~15× token multiplier vs a chat
baseline** (single agents ~4×) `[official]` — are *three distinct measurements*, not one exchange
rate; together they say the same thing: the exchange is steep, and token spend alone explains ~80%
of agentic-research performance variance `[official]` (so cheap-tier runs systematically
underperform, raising the cost of a routing miss, §5.3). This harness buys parallelism for
*validation* (independent lenses, cheap wall-clock) structurally, and for *implementation* only
under the admission rule.

**Worktree pooling (Stage 2):** per-pipeline *environment* cold-start is pooled away — a warm
pool of lease-held worktrees (env-setup hooks run once per pool member; **durable leases**
survive worker death, so a pipeline that dies mid-run keeps its home for the disk-resume;
teardown is **fail-closed** behind precise "landed" semantics — patch-ID containment after
squash merges, refusal when the remote is unreachable — and per-risk opt-in flags, never a
blanket force) ([unattended-operation-prior-art.md §4](../../../evidence-lake/ai/unattended-operation/unattended-operation-prior-art.md)).
This is an **O2 win only**: a stable pool-slot cwd stabilizes the cache key, but each commit
still cold-starts the next session's prefix (git snapshot in the system prompt), so the
per-pipeline *cache* warmup above stays in the admission cost.

**Window-phase scheduling:** heavy fan-out (big panels, multi-task bursts) schedules right
after a window reset; the tail of a window runs cheap serial work. The 5-hour anchor-at-first-
message behavior `[measured]` even allows deliberate window alignment to the operator's day
(the "warmup" pattern `[folklore]` — surfaced as an operator note, not automated).

### 6.3 Human latency

- **Park-and-continue:** a blocked task parks; the loop continues other runnable work — a
  human answer is never on the critical path of unrelated tasks.
- **Foreseeable questions surface at ratification, not mid-firing** *(2026-07-05 amendment,
  I19)*: ratification is the one moment the operator is guaranteed present, so `plan_ready`
  and the pre-ratification `preflight` simulate every statically-evaluable pre-spawn gate
  (floors×touches, H9×existing-handoffs) and force adjudication then. Mid-firing operator
  asks are reserved for what genuinely could not be known earlier.
- **Batch ratifications** at phase close: machinery proposals, consequential plan revisions,
  and efficiency tunings queue and are ratified in one sitting; push notification on
  queue-append. Each queued item is a **decision card** (format in §7).
- An `assisted` autonomy level = a merge *queue* (work continues on task branches), not
  stop-the-world.
- Blockers carry everything needed to decide (repro, options, recommendation) so one
  round-trip resolves them.
- **Card-first, ask-second** *(2026-07-05 amendment, P3v2-1)*: every operator decision is
  written to disk as a blocker card (`asked_at` stamped) and reflected as `parked` in the
  ledger **before** any interactive prompt — the card is the question; a prompt is one
  delivery vehicle for it. Interactive asks are legal only when parking leaves nothing
  admissible, and a best-effort desktop notification (`tools/notify_operator.sh`) fires on
  every operator-blocking event. Pilot-3-v2 held an unnoticed interactive prompt (first
  measured 8h25m; ≲85 min after the P3v2-3 clock correction — unbounded either way, which
  is the point) with no card on disk and the ledger claiming `in_progress` — a dead session
  would have lost the question entirely. `parked→resumed` timestamps make operator-wait a
  measured wall-clock cost (O2).
- **Pause = acknowledge, drain, park — never kill, never deaf** *(2026-07-05 amendment,
  I23/P3v2-8)*: worker attempts are atomic — disk-is-memory holds at handoff boundaries,
  not mid-attempt — so killing an in-flight attempt trades latency for rework. A pause
  request is acknowledged on disk (`state/pause.ack`) the moment the loop sees it; new
  admissions stop; in-flight attempts drain to their handoffs; then the clean pause runs.
  The orchestrator must stay responsive enough to see the flag at all: workers spawn in
  the background and the flag is checked at every stage boundary, so pause latency is one
  poll interval to acknowledge and the longest in-flight attempt to land. The flag file
  (writable from any terminal) is the operator's channel into a live firing — a message
  typed into the firing session itself starves until the turn yields.
- **Spec-ambiguity blockers** *(2026-07-04 evening amendment)*: the spec is the one shared
  input blind validation cannot audit — spec↔intent divergence is validated-wrong-software.
  The test-author already surfaces spec ambiguities in its handoff; on **high/critical
  profiles those become blocker records that park the task before the implementer spends
  tokens** on an ambiguous spec (one operator round-trip resolves them, same E3 machinery).
  On lower profiles they stay advisory `key_learnings`.
  - *Dual-covered discharge (2026-07-05 amendment, P3v2-1)*: an ambiguity whose held-out
    corpus **passes under every reading** cannot produce validated-wrong software — the
    test-author records it as `corpus_covers: "both"` and it is **discharged** (advisory on
    all profiles, no operator round-trip). Pilot-3-v2 spent an 8-hour operator round-trip
    re-deriving exactly this from prose notes: all 10 GL1 ambiguities were dual-covered in
    prose but blocked anyway. The discharge is the test-author's recorded, auditable claim
    (the handoff rides the evidence store) and is reversible by re-authoring; blocking
    remains for every ambiguity the corpus pins to one reading.

## 7. The correctness floor (O0)

The optimizers above are only safe on top of this floor, and the research says it is the
differentiator ([landscape-and-novelty.md §2](../../../evidence-lake/ai/harness-landscape/landscape-and-novelty.md)):

- **Blind adversarial validation:** fresh-context validators; the spec is the only shared
  input; implementer reasoning never crosses (self-recognition causes self-preference —
  [correctness-and-verification-evidence.md §2](../../../evidence-lake/ai/validation/correctness-and-verification-evidence.md));
  held-out adversarial tests; the merge gate reproduced from a clean checkout
  (a `--require-clean` mode refuses a dirty tree).
- **Vault isolation is a six-layer stack, not a flag** (design open question #3 closed;
  [isolation-and-sandboxing.md](../../../evidence-lake/ai/isolation/isolation-and-sandboxing.md)): (1) sandbox
  `denyRead` on the vault path (OS-enforced for Bash + children, macOS Seatbelt / Linux
  bubblewrap); (2) Read/Edit deny rules covering the built-in file tools (absolute precedence,
  symlink-resolving) — since the sandbox covers only Bash and the built-in tools bypass it;
  (3) strict-mode flags `allowUnsandboxedCommands: false` and `failIfUnavailable: true` on
  unattended runs, without which the boundary is prompt-dependent (a Claude Code agent has
  autonomously disabled its own sandbox and bypassed path denylists `[measured]`); (4) deny
  rules and sandbox config in a scope the worker cannot write; (5) network egress control so the
  vault is unreachable with any worker credential (no SSH-agent forwarding; proxy allowlist);
  (6) per-role isolation via separate processes (subagents inherit the parent sandbox, so the
  design's headless one-shot workers are what makes divergent implementer/validator policy
  possible). Permission enforcement is harness-level, not model-level — a CLAUDE.md instruction
  not to look is not access control `[official]`. Proven by a **vault-canary read-attempt** in
  the gate self-tests: the isolation is verified by a failing read, never assumed.
- **Diverse-lens panels, all-must-pass;** consensus voting only for redundant panels
  (popularity-trap evidence,
  [correctness-and-verification-evidence.md §3](../../../evidence-lake/ai/validation/correctness-and-verification-evidence.md)).
  *Amended 2026-07-04 evening:* model heterogeneity is **weak insurance, not a diversity
  mechanism** — LLM errors correlate strongly (~60% same-wrong-answer agreement when two models
  err, rising with capability, persisting across providers; judges favor similar models —
  [§3 addendum](../../../evidence-lake/ai/validation/correctness-and-verification-evidence.md)). N same-family validators
  are not N independent draws. What de-correlates is **leverage diversity** (held-out execution,
  clean-checkout reproduction, distinct lenses on distinct artifacts) — marginal panel tokens
  buy a new lens or new leverage, never another same-family opinion. **Panel-correlation
  telemetry:** calibration-canary results aggregate panel-wide — a planted defect missed by
  *all* lenses is recorded as a correlated blind spot (feeds §8). For critical profiles a
  **cross-provider validator** (API-billed, outside the Max windows) is available as a
  decision-card option — operator-ratified, never a silent default.
- **Mechanized risk floors:** a path-glob → minimum-profile map enforced at the merge point by
  inspecting the *actual diff paths* (a mis-tagged security task cannot be validated cheaply
  and merged silently); a machinery-paths check (task branches cannot edit the loop's own
  machinery); a held-out-test-drop check; a destructive-git blocker — all enforced by hooks, all
  **fail-closed** (an enforcement gate that cannot run refuses the merge; only *advisory*
  layers — triage annotations, suggestions — fail open), all self-tested.
  *Amended 2026-07-04 evening — enforcement is only real once wired and triggered:*
  1. **Hook registration is part of the floor.** A committed settings artifact registers every
     enforcement hook (PreToolUse/Stop); registration lives in a scope workers cannot write
     (isolation layer 4 extended from gate *config* to hook *registration*); the gate self-tests
     **fail when registration is absent** or points off the ratified scripts. Unregistered
     hooks are a library, not an enforcement layer.
  2. **Merge interlock.** During a live firing, `git merge`/`git push` to protected refs is
     hook-intercepted and requires a **fresh PASS gate stamp bound to that branch + HEAD SHA**
     — "merge only through the gate" is machinery, not a skill sentence. Outside firings
     (operator/machinery development) the interlock is inert.
  3. **Spawn interlock.** Worker spawns during a firing require a **fresh admission decision
     stamp** (governor + scheduler output) — the firstmate enforce-that-judgment-happened
     pattern ([unattended-operation-prior-art.md §8](../../../evidence-lake/ai/unattended-operation/unattended-operation-prior-art.md));
     "governor between tasks" stops being prose.
  4. **Mandatory-step manifest.** The gate loads a per-profile required-steps manifest from the
     ratified ref; a required input that is absent **fails closed** — "caller's choice" passes
     survive only where the profile's manifest says so.
  5. **Workers deny machinery unconditionally.** Worker settings deny Edit/Write on machinery
     paths regardless of branch name — the branch-prefix allowlist is a convenience for the
     loop's own development, not a security boundary a worker can adopt.
- **Typed gate findings — who may fix what:** gate steps emit findings as `severity
  (error|warning|info)` × `action (auto-fix|ask-user|no-op)` with **per-step auto-fix budgets**
  (review-class findings default to 0 — always human); safe mechanical fixes are applied by
  the gate pipeline, never by the implementer being judged.
  *Amended 2026-07-04 evening — false FAILs are the symmetric, measured failure
  ([correctness-and-verification-evidence.md §7](../../../evidence-lake/ai/validation/correctness-and-verification-evidence.md):
  ~79–83% of raw multi-agent findings killed by adversarial refutation; consensus endorsed a
  non-existent vulnerability, killed only by one empirical test):* error-severity findings from
  validator FAIL verdicts carry a **machine-replayable repro** (command + expectation) that the
  **gate re-executes in the clean checkout before the FAIL blocks** — reproduction becomes
  machinery, not a claimed quote (fabricated execution is a measured behavior). A finding whose
  repro does not reproduce **downgrades to ask-user** (it cannot silently hard-block), and is
  counted — the run-log tracks an **unreproduced-findings (false-FAIL) rate** per lens/tier so
  the controller sees verifier precision, which otherwise poisons the escalation ladder and the
  >40% break-even telemetry invisibly. Repro-required is per-profile config (floored/critical
  profiles mandatory; judgment-only lenses on low profiles may stay ask-user by default). **Executable gate/hook config
  loads only from the ratified default branch at a freshly-fetched commit** — never from the
  task branch under test (extends the isolation stack's layer 4 to config that *executes*;
  fetch failure empties those fields rather than falling back to a stale copy). **Evidence
  directories:** each gated task commits its validation evidence (transcripts, probe outputs,
  gate captures) where it rides review — the durable input to the escapes log and
  `docs/EVIDENCE.md` ([unattended-operation-prior-art.md §5](../../../evidence-lake/ai/unattended-operation/unattended-operation-prior-art.md));
  held-out execution output is the exception — it routes to the vault-side store and in-repo
  reports are manifest-scrubbed (§5.5 point 5), so evidence never becomes the leak around the
  vault.
- **Self-reports are claims, not evidence** `[measured, replicated]`: agents cheat on ≥16% of
  successful long-horizon runs and fabricate execution they never performed
  ([harness-evaluation-prior-art.md §5.3](../../../evidence-lake/ai/evaluation/harness-evaluation-prior-art.md)) — so no
  status transition, verdict, or resume decision is made from a model's own summary. The loop
  reconstructs from artifacts (git delta, gate outputs, ledger) before acting; "never
  summarize a run from memory" is a standing orchestrator rule.
- **Self-measuring verifier loop:** a committed **escapes log** (defects a panel missed —
  labeled ground truth) + **calibration canaries** (plant a known defect the panel should
  catch before trusting any "0 findings" downgrade; a miss freezes the downgrade) +
  contract-test kill-rate calibration (a weak visible oracle raises rigor, never lowers it).
  *Amended 2026-07-04 evening — "escapes ≈ 0" needs a discovery channel or it is
  unfalsifiable* (greenfield + solo operator + no production users ≈ nothing notices a
  merged-but-wrong change; canaries only measure the planted-defect distribution, and ~27% of
  real faults are uncoupled from standard mutants). Three mechanisms make the number mean
  something: **(a) deterministic escape backfill** — any defect surfaced by a later task/phase
  on a merged surface files an escapes-log entry attributed to the merging task *and* the panel
  that passed it; **(b) sampled escape-hunts** — a scheduled, budget-governed re-audit of a
  random sample of merged surface by a fresh high-tier panel; **(c) flip conditions read
  "zero *discovered* escapes with the discovery channel active"** — a silent log with no active
  discovery mechanism gates nothing.
- **Closure gate** vs a plan snapshot frozen at build start, a fresh-evidence rule (only
  evidence newer than the last remediation can decide), bounded remediation rounds.
- **Governed self-modification:** the loop proposes; a human ratifies machinery changes via a
  committed ratification queue (`docs/PROPOSALS.md`); headless runs cannot edit their own
  machinery (self-modifying loops can encode a bypass of their own safeguards without
  "deciding" to —
  [correctness-and-verification-evidence.md §5](../../../evidence-lake/ai/validation/correctness-and-verification-evidence.md)).
  Queue entries are **decision cards**
  ([unattended-operation-prior-art.md §6](../../../evidence-lake/ai/unattended-operation/unattended-operation-prior-art.md)):
  deterministic *Situation* → advisory triage (**cached per content revision** — one triage
  per revision, ever: spend control) → *Recommended action* → exactly-one-choice options; each
  card carries a **content hash**, and a ratification is **refused if the proposal changed
  after review** (stale-decision guard). Advisory triage fails open (a failed triage still
  publishes the card); execution stays with deterministic code after human approval, and no
  autonomy level relaxes the human carve-out for destructive/irreversible/security-sensitive
  changes.

## 8. The controller — closing the loop on both objectives

A periodic reflection step doubles as the cost/quality controller, optimizing the §2 objective
explicitly:

- **Inputs:** per-role token telemetry (+ effort), a $/MTok cost table per model, window
  telemetry from the budget governor, catch-rate vs the escapes log, calibration results,
  concurrency-attributed rework, the evidence roll-up; *(2026-07-04 evening)* the
  **false-FAIL rate** (unreproduced error findings per lens/tier, §7) and **panel-correlation
  telemetry** (all-lenses-missed canaries, §7) — verifier *precision* and panel *independence*
  are tracked quantities, not assumptions.
- **Levers:** implementer/test-author starting tier, validator tier/count/lens-set,
  per-profile effort, the concurrency cap, vault replay rate, window ceilings.
- **Discipline:** one lever at a time; minimum-sample floors; model-id/effort changes reset
  samples; every downgrade needs a fresh calibration PASS; protected profiles strengthen-only;
  all tunings queue to the ratification queue with a cost/benefit estimate — never
  auto-applied. Lever evaluations follow the **paired-arm template**: one lever = one arm,
  continuous metric (never binarized), paired per-task comparison, difficulty stratification
  defined out-of-sample, confirmatory-vs-exploratory labeling
  ([harness-evaluation-prior-art.md §2](../../../evidence-lake/ai/evaluation/harness-evaluation-prior-art.md)).
- **Justification surface:** a committed evidence trail (`docs/EVIDENCE.md`, regenerated from
  telemetry) answers *is it catching real defects, is the cost justified, which features
  actually fire* — and drives subtraction: dormant non-insurance machinery gets flagged for
  pruning; insurance machinery (floors, calibration, closure, budget) is never dropped on
  dormancy, since there silence is the desired state.

## 9. Failure modes and mitigations

| Failure mode | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Stuck loop burning window budget | Liveness guard: multi-signal park (git-delta authoritative; repeated-error signature; slow-grind vs predicted duration bucket); a per-task step-count cap, since per-run token cost grows ~O(n²) in agent steps `[folklore]`, so a stuck retry loop is a multi-million-token event; a per-task **token** cap (from the §5.1 P95 forecast) checked mid-flight, not only between tasks; and a **no-op rule** — a turn with zero git delta and zero new artifacts counts as a *failure*, so the loop halts instead of spinning |
| Doomed trajectory keeps spending | Abort-on-predicted-failure check inside long-running tasks (recovers 28–64% of failing-run tokens `[measured]`; agents won't self-throttle, r=0.35); observe-only until false-abort rate is proven against O0 (§5.6) |
| Budget wall mid-panel (wasted panel) | Between-task budget-governor check; degrade→pause ladder; quantile window-aware admission (§5.1, §6.2) |
| Cache thrash (the silent 10–20× event) | Frozen-prefix rules (model/effort/fast-mode/bare-tool-deny are the real busters) + prefix-edit warning hook; small CLAUDE.md; no huge-transcript resumes (§5.2) |
| Idle-session resume pre-consumes a fresh window | Treat any idle resume as a heavy admission (charges full accumulated cache context to the new window — 15M tokens for ~20k real work `[measured]`); prefer fresh session + disk resume over `--resume` (§5.2 rule 4) |
| Weak visible tests (green-but-wrong; the ~31% problem) | Held-out layer + contract-test kill-rate calibration + held-out-drop check at merge |
| Vault goes stale / gets gamed | Mandatory fresh authoring on changed surface; leakage budget; rotation; no replay on risk-floored surfaces (§5.5) |
| Vault read by the implementer | Six-layer OS-enforced isolation stack + vault-canary read-attempt in gate self-tests (§7); strict-mode flags mandatory on unattended runs |
| Pulled-forward task gets invalidated (wasted tokens) | `start-early-safe` predicate (`mayBeInvalidatedBy`); conservative default |
| Parallel burst empties the window, then stalls | Admission rule forecast (P95 quantile, includes per-pipeline cache warmup); window-phase scheduling (§6.2) |
| Router misroutes (worse than random on unfamiliar distribution) | Verified-FAIL escalation signal (not a learned scorer); >40% break-even trip-up; validate predictor features vs measured burn before flag-flip (§5.3) |
| Subpar plan (worse than no plan) | Human approval gate on the plan document ([correctness-and-verification-evidence.md §4](../../../evidence-lake/ai/validation/correctness-and-verification-evidence.md)); phase-close reflection re-scopes remaining phases |
| Limits change under the harness (they did, 7+ times) | No hard-coded magnitudes; empirical ceiling calibration; §10.3 changelog discipline; re-check after 2026-07-13 promo expiry and the paused Agent-SDK regime change |
| Concurrent firings | Manual trigger + advisory run marker + operator arbitration |
| Reward hacking / stale-green | The whole §7 floor; hooks un-skippable at merge/stop points |
| Hallucinated FAIL blocks a merge / drives paid escalation | Executable-repro replay at the gate before an error finding blocks; unreproduced findings downgrade to ask-user; false-FAIL rate tracked per lens/tier (§7) |
| Correlated panel blind spot (same-family validators agree on the same miss) | Leverage diversity over model-count redundancy; panel-wide canary aggregation as correlation telemetry; optional cross-provider validator card on critical profiles (§7) |
| Merged-but-wrong change never discovered ("escapes ≈ 0" reads as safety) | Escape backfill rule + sampled escape-hunts; flips require an active discovery channel (§7) |
| Unattended firing on stale/optimistic quota data | Readings carry age (stale → margin widens, rung falls through); firing preflight starts conservative when no live rung is reachable (§5.1) |
| Orchestrator skips a mandatory step (gate, governor) | Merge + spawn interlocks demand fresh stamps during firings; mandatory-step manifest fails the gate closed on absent inputs; hook registration self-tested (§7) |

## 10. Appendix — Max-window facts the design depends on

### 10.1 Established

- 5-hour window anchors at first message; usage bar + reset time visible in `/usage`
  `[measured; official docs deliberately don't specify mechanics]`.
- Weekly: one overall cap + one **Sonnet-only** cap since 2025-11-24 (Opus cap removed);
  fixed per-account weekly reset `[official]`.
- One shared pool across Claude app, all Claude Code sessions, IDE, and (currently) the Agent
  SDK / headless `-p`; the operator's own interactive use drains it too `[official, re-verified
  2026-07-04]`.
- **Live utilization is machine-readable in-session:** the statusline stdin JSON exposes
  `rate_limits.five_hour/seven_day.used_percentage` + `resets_at` and `context_window.current_usage`
  cache counters `[official]` — the governor's primary source (§5.1), with documented caveats:
  subscriber-only, appears after the first API response, each window independently absent. No
  dedicated quota CLI yet (anthropics/claude-code#13585 open — re-verified 2026-07-04 through
  changelog v2.1.201, zero maintainer responses); headless firings have no official quota
  surface (OTEL confirmed consumption-only by exact metric list).
- **1-hour cache TTL is automatic on subscription auth** (drops to 5 min on usage credits);
  subagents get 5-min TTL and start cold; forks inherit the parent cache `[official]`.
- Thinking tokens bill as output; effort is a depletion factor and a **soft** budget (overshoot
  tail), not a hard cap `[official]`.
- Extra usage at API rates via `/usage-credits`; `$2k/day` redemption cap; **opt-in-in-advance,
  no silent spillover** `[official]`.
- Session prefix floor ≈ 20–30k tokens; multipliers vs a chat baseline: agents ~4×, multi-agent
  ~15× `[official/measured]`; agent-teams ~7× `[official/measured; not re-verified 2026-07-04]`.

### 10.2 Contested — design takes the conservative branch

**Do cache reads count against subscription limits?** API-side, cache reads bill at ~10% price
and are exempt from ITPM rate limits `[official]`. Subscription-side: still officially
**unanswered**, and community telemetry now points toward **near-full window weight** — one
report attributed ~70M tokens (>99% cache) in <2h and was closed "not planned" with no answer;
the 1,310:1 single-user ratio is the other datapoint `[contested]`. Design assumption:
**cache reads are cheap but not free; a cache-busted turn is catastrophic either way** — so the
discipline in §5.2 is unconditional, and the budget governor counts cache reads at a configurable
weight (default conservative) until Anthropic documents the truth. This is the single
highest-value controlled measurement to run — the protocol and runner are built, not yet
executed (§12 open question 2).

### 10.3 Volatility log (why nothing is hard-coded)

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2025-08-28 | Weekly caps introduced (overall + Opus) `[official]` |
| 2025-11-24 | Opus weekly cap removed; overall raised; Sonnet gets its own cap `[official]` |
| 2026-01 | Unannounced Opus tightening reported `[measured]` |
| ~2026-03 | Peak-hour throttling; client cache bug (10–20× inflation) `[measured]` |
| 2026-04-23 | Cache bug fixed + limit resets `[measured]` |
| 2026-05-06 | 5-hour limits doubled; peak throttling removed `[official]` |
| 2026-05-13 → **2026-07-13** | +50% weekly promo — **current headroom is inflated; recalibrate ceilings after expiry** `[measured]` |
| 2026-06-15 announced → **PAUSED** | Agent SDK / `claude -p` / third-party usage would move **off** the rate windows onto a monthly dollar credit (Pro $20 / Max 5x $100 / Max 20x $200; interactive terminal/IDE carved out). Currently paused — all usage still draws the windows. **If un-paused, headless firings stop draining windows and O1 becomes dollar-budget management** — abstract "which pool does this spend drain" now `[official, re-verified 2026-07-04]` |

## 11. Rollout — staged, measured flips

Cheapest proven lever first; each flip gated on the previous stage's telemetry.

- **Stage 0 (day one):** frozen-prefix cache discipline + prefix-edit warning hook; budget
  governor reading the statusline `rate_limits` feed, thresholds **observe-only** (log crossings,
  don't act — untuned hard caps stall the loop `[folklore]`), serial execution; per-profile
  starting-tier override; the vault-isolation strict-mode flags on every unattended firing;
  pipelining + pre-decompose; step-count caps; structured outputs on all worker returns;
  `DISABLE_NON_ESSENTIAL_MODEL_CALLS` on headless firings; the **token-free loop test rig** —
  a deterministic mock worker speaking the return schemas (synthetic usage counters, scripted
  workspace effects, hold-open turns for cancellation paths) plus recorded-trace replay, so
  the loop/governor/ledger are e2e-testable at zero quota; re-recording real fixtures spends
  quota and is operator-gated
  ([unattended-operation-prior-art.md §7](../../../evidence-lake/ai/unattended-operation/unattended-operation-prior-art.md)).
  *Added 2026-07-04 evening:* **hook registration + interlocks + gate step-manifest** (the §7
  wiring amendments — enforcement is only real once registered and triggered) and the
  **firing preflight / staleness-aware governor** (§5.1). **Stage-0 exit criterion: a real
  pilot firing** — a small greenfield build at Stage-0 settings producing the first real
  run-log/canary/calibration data and operator-gated recorded traces to replace the mock rig's
  synthetic fixtures. No further machinery ships before the pilot; the apparatus has outrun
  realized scale once already ([landscape-and-novelty.md §4.1](../../../evidence-lake/ai/harness-landscape/landscape-and-novelty.md)).
- **Stage 1 (after the minimum task sample):** flip governor thresholds from observe-only to
  enforcing; per-profile effort via the Workflow spawn path, effort recorded in the run-log; the
  duration predictor, gated on (a) the simple starting-tier lever showing escapes ~0 and $/task
  down **and** (b) its features validated against measured burn; intra-task early-abort in
  observe-only; cross-phase DAG scheduling behind a conservative `start-early-safe` predicate.
- **Stage 2 (needs Stage-1 evidence):** held-out vault + safe-RTS replay (non-floored surfaces
  first, replay rate-limited); intra-task early-abort enforcing once the false-abort rate is
  proven against O0; concurrency cap 2 under the admission rule (including per-pipeline cache
  warmup in the cost side), with the run-log attributing rework to concurrency; the pooled
  lease-based worktree lifecycle (§6.2).
- **Stage 3 (optional, evidence-gated):** the full bucket×profile starting-tier matrix;
  test-execution caching (bounded to non-security surfaces, mandatory cache-defeat on the
  changed surface — explicitly down-weighted by the objective).
- **Standing:** recalibrate window ceilings after 2026-07-13 (promo expiry), re-check the paused
  Agent-SDK regime change (§10.3), and after any entry lands in §10.3; re-run
  `tools/budget-governor/probe-spawn-portability.js` on any new Claude Code build or
  environment before trusting per-agent `(model, effort)` dispatch (§12 reclassified item);
  *(2026-07-04 evening)* **re-audit the §4 leverage map on each Claude Code feature wave** —
  custom residue a new built-in now covers gets migrated, not maintained (first candidate:
  build-loop control flow as a Workflow script — deterministic tick order, schema-forced agent
  returns, resume journal — with the skill reduced to judgment-only guidance; evaluate, don't
  mandate: workflow scripts have no direct shell access, so deterministic modules stay
  hook/gate-side regardless).

## 12. Open questions

*Trimmed 2026-07-04:* the five founding questions are now **two**. The other three are
reclassified below — they stopped being open *design* questions once the design absorbed
their mitigations; what remains of each is scheduled work, not uncertainty.

1. **Headless quota surface** (anthropics/claude-code#13585 — re-verified 2026-07-04: still
   open, 22 comments all community, zero maintainer responses; changelog checked through
   v2.1.201): there is still **no official machine-readable quota surface for `claude -p`** —
   OTEL exports consumption metrics only (verified by exact metric list; no utilization or
   reset gauge), and the statusline `rate_limits` feed is interactive-only with documented
   caveats (§10.1). The question has therefore *narrowed* from "does a surface exist?"
   (settled: no) to **which fallback to wire for unattended firings**, ranked:
   (a) the **statusline-dump shim** (§5.1) — official data, unofficial acquisition, stales
   when the host session idles; (b) the unofficial OAuth-usage endpoint — with the probed
   caveat (2026-07-04, this dev machine) that credentials are **not non-interactively
   accessible everywhere** (no credentials file, no Keychain item), so this rung requires
   explicit per-environment operator wiring; (c) the run-log estimate (optimistic, sticky-`~`,
   §5.1). The ladder upgrades in place if #13585 ships.
2. **Cache-read quota weight** (§10.2) — *the highest-value experiment*: a matched-content
   cache-preserving vs cache-busting protocol is written and ready
   ([tools/budget-governor/cache-read-quota-weight-experiment.md](../../tools/budget-governor/cache-read-quota-weight-experiment.md)),
   with a working runner script, but **deliberately not yet executed** — it spends real Max-plan
   quota, so the operator decides when to run it (ideally right after a window reset).
   Re-checked 2026-07-04: still no official statement (#24147 unanswered); one new *indirect*
   official signal — the `/usage` plan-limits attribution itemizes **cache misses** as a limit
   driver, implying hits are weighted differently, weight unstated. The conservative
   configurable-weight assumption stands until the experiment runs.

*Reclassified 2026-07-04 — no longer open design questions:*

- **Per-agent effort portability** (was #3): the design no longer depends on the answer —
  spawn code validates `(model, effort)` against an explicit allowlist and null-checks results
  (§5.3), so a primitive that silently accepts bad ids can no longer misroute silently.
  Residual = a standing recheck: re-run
  [tools/budget-governor/probe-spawn-portability.js](../../tools/budget-governor/probe-spawn-portability.js)
  on any new build/environment (§11 Standing); the parallel-`Agent`-calls fallback remains the
  default on unprobed builds.
- **Window-occupancy forecasting** (was #4): the method is settled — P95-quantile
  profile×tier estimates first (§5.1), duration-bucket upgrade gated on feature validation
  (§11 Stage 1) — and the plumbing is now testable at zero quota via the token-free mock rig
  (§11 Stage 0). Residual = feeding it real telemetry once tasks flow: a calibration gate,
  not a design choice. Tools built and self-tested:
  [tools/budget-governor/](../../tools/budget-governor/).
- **Headless quota regime** (was #5): re-verified 2026-07-04 — the Agent-SDK/`claude -p`
  billing change is **still paused** (official support article live; the only promised lead
  time is "before anything takes effect"), so headless firings still drain the shared
  windows. The "which pool does this spend drain" abstraction the question asked for is in
  the governor's window model (§5.1). Residual = the volatility watch already scheduled in
  §11 Standing / §10.3.

*Resolved since the founding draft:* **vault sandbox enforcement** (the founding draft's open
question #3) — the six-layer OS-enforced isolation stack, proven by a vault-canary
read-attempt in the gate self-tests (§7;
[isolation-and-sandboxing.md](../../../evidence-lake/ai/isolation/isolation-and-sandboxing.md)).
