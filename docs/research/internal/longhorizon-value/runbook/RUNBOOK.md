# Long-horizon value experiment — operator runbook

Everything here is prepared so that starting the experiment is **one command per arm**.
Design authority: [../chain-design.md](../chain-design.md) (REGISTERED 2026-07-16; three
arms, pre-registered arm-F decision rules, canaries at T3/T6, compounding-depth metric).
All 11 specs are ratified and strict-preflight clean under [../specs/](../specs/).
**Every run script below spends real quota and is operator-run by design** (quota
discipline): each refuses to start without `--yes`, and nothing here is wired into any
loop, gate, test, or CI.

## The arms (one command each, independent repos — any order, any spacing)

| Arm | Command | What runs | Measured/estimated notional cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **H** — gated harness | `./run-arm-H.sh --yes` | 11 × exec-loop full tier: blind Opus author → seal → confined Sonnet 5 implementer (≤3 same-model attempts, counts-only feedback) → hard gate → ff-merge; **stops honestly on blocker** | ~$7.10/task measured → **~$80** |
| **N** — diligent Sonnet | `./run-arm-N.sh --yes` | 11 × fresh Sonnet 5 session on `main`: same spec/context/checks as H's implementer, no gate, no stop channel | ~$2–3/task → **~$30** |
| **F** — frontier solo | `./run-arm-F.sh --yes` | same as N with Opus 4.8 (budget-neutral challenge to the gate) | ~$5–7.6/task → **~$60–85** |

Sessions run serially within an arm (~25 min/task measured on the pilot ⇒ roughly a
working day per arm, unattended). Arms are independent (separate clones, ledgers,
held-out roots) — run them in the same window or days apart; each is resumable
(completed work is skipped on re-run).

## Before first run (one-time, free)

```sh
./setup-arms.sh          # toolchain probe, 3 arm clones @ c646832, held-out roots, admission
./run-arm-N.sh --dry-run # free: builds all 11 bundles, launcher prints what WOULD spawn
./run-arm-F.sh --dry-run
```

## Recommended before arms: the second held-out slice (`./author-slice2.sh --yes`, ~$45)

The in-loop blind suites **gate arm H and then grade every arm** — that circularity is
named in the chain design; the pre-registered arm-F rules and the canaries survive it, but
head-to-head silent-wrong *rates* need an oracle no arm was optimized against. This script
authors that second slice (11 fresh blind Opus authors against base, sealed, grading-only).
Skipping it is legitimate — it just restricts head-to-head claims to canaries + arm-F rules.
**Additive, not a substitute**: slice-2 does not replace or reduce arm H's in-loop
authoring — H authors its own gating suites regardless (that step is part of the machinery
under test, and part of H's ~$80). One suite cannot do both jobs: gating H on a suite is
exactly what destroys its independence as the head-to-head oracle.

## Cross-repo read walls (walls, not politeness)

The sandbox confines writes and denies only *listed* reads — everything else on disk is
readable, so a live worker could in principle read a sibling arm's finished code, the
sealed slice-2 grading suites, or outrigger (whose chain design names the canary
locations). Behavior makes this ≈0 (workers have no pointer to those paths); the
experiment's standard is walls anyway:

- **Arms N/F**: the runner spawns every worker with deny-read walls over the slice-2
  root, arm H's held-out root, outrigger, and the sibling arm repos (launcher params;
  the launcher refuses to spawn if it cannot express them).
- **All arms, repo-scope**: `make_walls.py` (run 2026-07-16) commits a `.claude/
  settings.json` with the same walls into EVERY arm repo (symmetric across arms; pre-run,
  so no worker diff touches it — arm H's protected-paths interlock guards it besides),
  and writes the equivalent file at arm H's held-out root for the in-loop AUTHORS
  (walling slice-2, both sibling arms, and outrigger/docs — the canary-naming surface —
  while outrigger/tools stays readable: the authoring role contract lives there).
  Re-run `make_walls.py` if the arm repos are ever recreated.
- **Probed 2026-07-16 (three live probes, transcripts in the session record), because the
  mechanism is vendor-build behavior**: (1) repo-scope settings BIND launcher-spawned
  workers (control read OK, walled reads refused with empty params); (2) the walls hold
  from a workspace SUBDIRECTORY of the held-out root (settings walk up from cwd); (3) the
  read matrix — the built-in Read tool is cwd-confined by default (pre-existing, pilot
  included), **bash is NOT** (`head` on unwalled external paths succeeds), and the walls
  block **both** channels ("operation not permitted" at the OS layer for a shell read of
  a walled path). Bash was the real open channel; the walls are load-bearing.
- **Slice-2 authors** ran before the walls: acceptable — during their run the arm repos
  contained only the shared base (nothing to leak, provable by timestamps), and the
  authoring flow's designed reads (own workspace, base repo, role contract) are exactly
  what remained reachable.

## Registered operational rules (protocol details fixed before any run)

- **Arm N/F prompt parity**: the ungated sessions receive the exec-loop implementer's
  instruction body verbatim (title, spec, plan goal/constraints/decisions, the same
  checks, the same commit protocol) with exactly one delta — they work on `main` directly
  instead of a confined worktree. No blind suite, no gate, no retry, no stop channel.
- **Arm N/F no-stop-channel rule**: a session that ends without committing (or with
  failing self-checks) is recorded on the ledger (`head_before == head_after`) and the
  chain **proceeds to the next task** — downstream compounding is the phenomenon under
  measurement, not an error to prevent. Only launcher-level failures (refusal, spawn
  error) abort a run: those are environment problems, not arm outcomes.
- **Arm H stop rule**: any exec-loop blocker halts the arm (that IS the honest-stop
  channel). Adjudicate via the two doors (amend spec → re-ratify → rerun, or edit suite →
  `seal --retire --adjudicated-by …` → rerun), append the `lesson_target` ledger record,
  re-run the script; completed plans are skipped via `runs/arm-H/completed.txt`.
- **Timeout parity**: 3600 s per implementer session in every arm.
- **Outcome vs infrastructure (all arms, same classification)**: a session that
  *completes* is an arm outcome, committed or not. A session that ends abnormally is
  infrastructure until adjudicated: a detected usage-window wall halts consuming nothing
  (the task/attempt is redone after the reset); any other abnormal end halts for operator
  adjudication — in N/F, `--accept-failure TASK_ID` records it as the arm's real outcome
  and continues. Infrastructure halts are never graded as honest-stops.
- **No mid-run peeking**: grading artifacts (suite replays, overlap runs) are produced
  only after an arm finishes; no arm ever receives feedback from them.

## Quota walls mid-run (expected, not exceptional)

A full arm is a working day of serial sessions, so hitting a 5-hour window cap mid-run is
the NORMAL case, not a failure. All three arms halt cleanly and resume exactly:

- **Arm H**: the exec-loop detects wall-shaped session failures (`window-wall` blocker,
  vendor strings, fail-open) and halts **without consuming the attempt** — no gate verdict
  is recorded, so re-running `run-arm-H.sh --yes` after the reset redoes that same attempt;
  completed plans are skipped, sealed suites persist. A wall blocker needs no two-door
  adjudication — just re-run. (Unrecognized errors fall back to normal attempt handling —
  fail-open means a pattern miss costs a wasted attempt, never a stranded run.)
- **Arms N/F**: the runner uses the same wall heuristic — wall ⇒ halt (exit 3), nothing
  recorded, task redone on re-run. Weekly cap: identical, longer wait. Sessions are
  serial, so at most one session's partial work is lost at any wall — and a fresh session
  never inherits it: before every spawn the runner discards any uncommitted leftovers
  (`reset --hard` + `clean -fd`, recorded as `discarded_dirty_tree`), enforcing "work not
  committed does not exist" mechanically. (Arm H gets this for free: each attempt runs in
  a dedicated worktree that is torn down and redone.)
- **author-slice2.sh**: fail-fast; sealed workspaces skip on re-run, an unsealed leftover
  is cleared and re-authored.
- **Grading and setup are quota-free** — walls cannot affect them.

## Following along (live, from a second terminal)

The run scripts print progress to the terminal they run in. The durable live signal for
every run is its **ledger** — one JSON line per event as it happens:

```sh
cd docs/research/internal/longhorizon-value
tail -f runs/arm-H/ledger.jsonl     # spawn / seal / gate verdict / merge / blocker
tail -f runs/arm-N/ledger.jsonl     # one outcome record per task (committed, heads, usage)
tail -f runs/slice2/ledger.jsonl    # one seal record (with anchor) per authored suite
python3 ../../../../tools/run-ledger/ledger.py summarize runs/arm-H/ledger.jsonl  # rollup
cat runs/arm-H/completed.txt                             # arm H: plans fully landed
git -C ~/repos/eaitl-arm-N log --oneline | head          # N/F: commits arriving
find ~/repos/eaitl-heldout-slice2 -name manifest.json | wc -l   # slice-2: sealed count /11
```

Worker-session transcripts (`…/bundles/*/transcript.txt`) are written when a session
**ends** (the launcher records the final message, not a live stream) — mid-session, the
ledger and the script's stdout are the only live signals.

## While an arm runs

- Arm H artifacts: `<heldout-root>/_runs/<plan>/` (bundles, gate reports, blocker.json);
  ledger `runs/arm-H/ledger.jsonl`.
- Arm N/F artifacts: `runs/arm-{N,F}/bundles/…` (instructions, params, result, transcript);
  ledger `runs/arm-{N,F}/ledger.jsonl` (per task: `committed`, heads, usage).
- Summaries: `python3 ../../../../../tools/run-ledger/ledger.py summarize runs/arm-H/ledger.jsonl`

## After the runs (free, post-hoc, non-adaptive)

```sh
# Replay every sealed suite (in-loop slice + slice 2 if authored) against each arm:
python3 grade_arm.py --arm-repo ~/repos/eaitl-arm-H \
    --workspaces ~/repos/eaitl-arm-H-heldout ~/repos/eaitl-heldout-slice2 \
    --out runs/arm-H/grade-report.json     # repeat for arm-N, arm-F
# Per-task self-tests-vs-blind-suite value readout (CPU-only mutation proxy):
python3 ../../../../../tools/test-overlap/…   # per its README, operator-run
```

Grading judgments made from the reports + ledgers (all pre-registered in chain-design):
three outcomes per task (correct-complete / honest-stop / silent-wrong), compounding
depth per landed silent-wrong, the arm-F decision rules, canary hits at T3/T6.

## Open decisions (none block starting)

1. **Second held-out slice** — recommended; one command above; skipping restricts
   head-to-head claims (chain-design "one circularity to control").
2. **Oracle granularity** (end-state-only vs per-step-accumulated + final) — a
   grading-time choice; the sealed suites support either; leaning per-step + final.
3. **Naive one-session floor** (`/goal` whole-plan) — optional cheap extra arm; subsumed
   by arm N per the settled decision; run only if wanted for the writeup.
4. **Continuous-thinking 4th arm** — named-but-unbuilt, default OFF (registered).
