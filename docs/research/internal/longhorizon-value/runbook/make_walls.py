"""make_walls.py — generate + install the OS deny-read walls for every arm
repo and for arm H's authoring root (walls, not politeness).

Two wall surfaces, per worker cwd:

1. Each ARM REPO gets a committed `.claude/settings.json` denying reads of:
   both held-out roots (slice-2 + arm H's), outrigger (the chain design names
   the canary locations), and the two SIBLING arm repos. Its own repo is
   never denied. Committed pre-run and identically-structured across arms
   (fair); arm H's protected-paths interlock guards `.claude/` against
   worker edits, and N/F workers additionally carry the same walls in their
   launcher params (belt and braces).

2. The ARM-H HELD-OUT ROOT gets a plain `.claude/settings.json` (not a git
   repo) for the in-loop AUTHORS whose cwd is a workspace under it: denies
   slice-2, both sibling arm repos, and outrigger/docs — but NOT the tools
   dir (the authoring role contract lives at tools/heldout-suite/ROLE.md and
   authors read it by design) and NOT the arm-H repo (authors read the
   target repo by design).

Idempotent. Run via setup-arms.sh or directly:  python3 make_walls.py
