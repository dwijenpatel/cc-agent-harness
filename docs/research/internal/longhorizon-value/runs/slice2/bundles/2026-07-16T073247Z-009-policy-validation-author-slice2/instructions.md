You are the TEST-AUTHOR for task `policy-validation`.

Your authoring workspace is: /Users/dwijen/repos/eaitl-heldout-slice2/policy-validation

Read /Users/dwijen/repos/eaitl-heldout-slice2/policy-validation/authoring/task.json (your task and the plan context) and /Users/dwijen/repos/eaitl-heldout-slice2/policy-validation/authoring/AUTHORING.md, then follow the role contract at /Users/dwijen/repos/outrigger/tools/heldout-suite/ROLE.md.

The target repository (base checkout) is: /Users/dwijen/repos/eaitl — read it to match conventions and real module paths. Write stdlib-unittest tests into /Users/dwijen/repos/eaitl-heldout-slice2/policy-validation/suite/ as test_*.py files.

At least one test must FAIL against the unchanged base (that is the seal policy); base-passing regression guards are welcome. You never run seal.
