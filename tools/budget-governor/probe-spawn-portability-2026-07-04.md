# Spawn-path portability probe — 2026-07-04

Resolves design doc §12 open question #3 ("per-agent effort portability") for the current
build. Re-run this probe (script below) whenever the harness moves to a new Claude Code build
or execution environment — portability, not a one-time fact, is the open question.

**Build:** Claude Code 2.1.45. **Method:** `Workflow` tool, `agent()` calls with `opts.effort` /
`opts.model`, schema-forced trivial replies. Full script:
[probe-spawn-portability.js](probe-spawn-portability.js).

## Results

| Probe | Input | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Effort dispatch | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` | **All 5 dispatched successfully** — `agent()` accepted `opts.effort` for every documented level, no errors. |
| Model override | `haiku`, `sonnet` | **Both dispatched successfully** — `agent()` accepted `opts.model` for both. |
| Invalid effort | `'ultra-mega'` | **Did NOT fail loud.** The call completed normally (no thrown error, no logged failure); the agent replied as expected. The invalid value was silently accepted/ignored rather than rejected. |
| Invalid model | `'gpt-99-turbo'` | **Fails, but asynchronously and non-throwing.** No JS exception was thrown at the call site (a `try/catch` around the `await` did not trigger). Instead: `agent()` resolved to `null` (its documented behavior "if... the subagent dies on a terminal API error after terminal retries"), and the workflow's own failure log recorded: `"[model:invalid] failed: There's an issue with the selected model (gpt-99-turbo). It may not exist or you may not have access to it."` |

## Correction to the design doc

§5.3 previously stated the Workflow spawn path was "verified by direct probe: all five effort
levels dispatch; model overrides are honored; **invalid ids fail loud**." The first two clauses
are reconfirmed. The third is **only half true**:

- **Invalid `effort` values are silently accepted** — no validation, no error, no log entry.
  A typo'd or stale effort string in a profile config would silently no-op the intended
  escalation without any signal.
- **Invalid `model` values do fail** — but as an async `null` result + a workflow-level log
  entry, not a synchronous throw. Code that only wraps the `agent()` call in try/catch (as this
  probe initially did) will not observe the failure; it must check for a `null`/falsy result.

## Design implication (actionable)

The primitive cannot be trusted to reject bad config on its own for `effort`, and only
partially for `model`. **The harness's spawn code must validate `(model, effort)` against an
explicit allowlist before calling `agent()`/`Workflow`**, and must check `agent()` results for
`null` rather than relying on a catchable exception. This is a mechanized-validation gap of
exactly the kind the design's own critique warns about (safety-relevant behavior must not be
assumed from the primitive's prose-implied contract) — see
[landscape-and-novelty.md §4](../../../evidence-lake/ai/harness-landscape/landscape-and-novelty.md) risk #1.

## Re-verification protocol

1. Run [probe-spawn-portability.js](probe-spawn-portability.js) via the `Workflow` tool.
2. Record: Claude Code version (`claude --version`), date, and the four result rows above.
3. If any row's behavior changed from this baseline, update this file (new dated section, don't
   overwrite) and re-check whether the spawn-code allowlist guard in §5.3 is still necessary or
   whether the primitive itself started validating.

## 2026-07-05 addendum — surfaces for the next re-run (P3v2-6 follow-up)

Pilot-3-v2 hit the `Agent`-path effort gap live (P3v2-6 → I24). A same-day
official-docs check (claude-code-guide) adds unprobed surfaces and one
conflict; none is trusted until measured, per this probe's own lesson
(**acceptance ≠ application** — the invalid-effort row above was silently
accepted too):

1. **Agent-definition frontmatter `effort:`** — sub-agents docs support
   `effort: low|medium|high|xhigh|max` in `.claude/agents/*.md` frontmatter,
   overriding session effort for `Agent`-tool spawns of that agent type
   (default: inherit). UNPROBED for application. If verified, pre-committed
   variants (e.g. `implementer-max.md`) give the Agent path a per-spawn
   effort rung with no mid-firing machinery edit. Probe: same hard task via
   `effort: low` vs `effort: max` variants; compare thinking-token deltas
   (benchmark round-2 method), never dispatch success.
2. **`--effort` CLI flag / `effortLevel` settings key** — headless
   `claude -p --effort` is already measured-applied (benchmark 2026-07 round
   2: low→max scales Sonnet 4.2×, Opus 3.1×, Fable 2.4×); the flag also works
   at interactive launch. Treat as the proven path; no new probe needed.
3. **Conflict to re-check on version moves:** docs list Haiku 4.5 as
   accepting low/medium/high/max (not xhigh); the local benchmark measured NO
   behavioral change for haiku at any effort (round 1; CLI silently
   tolerant). Measured wins for the tested build.

## 2026-07-05 evening — I26 live probe (build 2.1.201, three real spawns)

Method: `harness.loop.headless_worker_cmd` argv, `headless_env`, worker
overlay (`write_worker_overlay`) denying a scratch "vault", cwd=scratch
worktree, `parse_worker_result` harvest. Model `claude-sonnet-5`.

| Probe | Result |
|---|---|
| A: deny binding | Worker asked to read the overlay-denied vault file replied exactly `CANNOT-READ` (exit 0). **Layer-stack binds headless**; harvest normalized usage + cost. |
| B: `--effort low` | Prime-sum question → **wrong answer (1060)**, 109 output tokens. |
| C: `--effort max` | Same question → **correct answer (3167)**, 5,947 output tokens. |

Findings:
1. **Effort is APPLIED on this path, not merely accepted** — 109 → 5,947
   output tokens (~55×) low→max on an identical prompt. The I26 ladder's
   `max` rung is real.
2. **Correctness inverted with effort** — sonnet@low wrong, sonnet@max
   right: a live replication of the benchmark round-2 finding ("effort-down
   is not a safe economy" on Sonnet 5), now on the harness's own worker path.
3. **Cache economics of the ladder:** same-model+same-effort spawns share
   the prefix cache (probe B read 27k of probe A's 37.5k creation); an
   effort change busts the prefix (probe C: 0 read, fresh 37.4k creation).
   Attempt-2@max therefore pays one fresh prefix — priced in, not a surprise.
4. `total_cost_usd` in the JSON doc is the CLI's notional figure; quota
   rides the subscription windows (no ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in worker env —
   `headless_env` guarantees it).
